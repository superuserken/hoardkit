1. Make the script executable.
    chmod +x find-dots.sh

    ./find-dots.sh (this will scan the current directory where the script is located and outputs the list of hidden files and directories in a text file located in the Desktop folder if you are on Linux)

    or 

    ./find-dots.sh /path/to/search /path/to/save/output (this will scan the path specified and outputs the list in the specified path)
